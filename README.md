- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that we were trying to solve was trying to load a csv file and search through that file and be able to display the information in the file and even delete an item. We were trying to do this in the most efficient way possible.

- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by testing various data structures to see which would be the most efficient. This is not the most efficient way to do this but as a first timer this was a good way to know what would work best for this situation. There is no one size fits all data structure so it's important to know which ones work most efficiently for each situation.

- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
There were a few times where my code was giving me trouble when trying to load the file. To overcome this roadblock I worked with fellow students in an SNHU Discord server to get tips on what could be going wrong.

- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I didn't realize how important it is to evaluate the data structure that we will use when developing a program and how much it can affect how well your program works. Not only is it important to write good, clean code but also avoid your program being sluggish by picking the wrong data structure for the job. This is something I will be considering every single time I code something from now on.
